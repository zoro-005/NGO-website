            <p class="lead">Sankalap Ek Sewa Foundation is a devoted animal welfare NGO based in Meerut, India, committed to rescuing and rehabilitating injured, abandoned, and critically ill animals—including cows, bulls, monkeys, dogs, and more. Since its inception just a year ago, our foundation has already rescued hundreds of voiceless lives, offering them advanced medical care and helping them return safely to their natural or familiar environments.</p>
            <p>Founded by lifelong animal advocates Mrs. Neetu Singh and Mr. Ajeet Singh, our organization blends empathy with action. From providing emergency aid in cases like acid attacks, road and railway accidents, cancer, and tumors, to routine efforts such as sterilization and vaccination, our team works tirelessly every day to protect animals who cannot speak for themselves.
